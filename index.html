               <p>Lego is my sanctuary. It brings me such a sense of peace to take the time to build a new set. Building lego sets can take me anywhere from a couple hours to a full week for completion. Creating new builds has taken over my hobby time and it is so rewarding.</p>

I find it helpful to put on a new movie to help the time fly. Having a media distraction on in the background also minimizes my stress if something goes wrong while building.</i>

This set currently resides in the entryway now in all her glory.</i></p>

Naturally I had to build it into to two sets. During the holiday time, I set each one in different rooms to have extra christmas spirit around the house! Lego thinks of everything when it comes to sets you can have on display.</i>
